abstract = {Abstract The Mondego estuary (Portugal) has been under environmental pressure since the early 1990s due to different anthropogenic stresses. The system has been studied following benthic communities' features from an impacted situation until the recovery phase, focusing mostly on macrobenthos. Following the application of mitigation measures in the estuary, this study is focused on the variability of the intertidal meiobenthic and nematode communities in a system that has recovered after different anthropogenic stresses. While at the spatial level (among areas along the eutrophication gradient) no significant differences were observed regarding the structure and function of the nematode communities, at the seasonal level some differences stood out. These results broadly suggest that the system has recovered from the early situations of pressures being, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to investigate the variability of intertidal meiobenthic and nematode communities in the scope of a system's recovery along an estuarine gradient of eutrophication. Even if performed in a short timeline, this study provides a good baseline analysis of conditions, being important for future comparisons.},

abstract = {The new biotic index BENFES (Benthic Families Ecological Status Index) for assessing the ecological status of soft-bottom communities based on presence/absence at the taxonomic family level, is described. BENFES was primarily developed for the communities from the Guadalquivir estuary (South-western Spain), but the aim of the present work was to evaluate the reliability and validity of this index for its application in the Water Framework Directive (WFD), especially as a preliminary and rapid assessment method for monitoring the ecological status of transitional and coastal waters. BENFES was compared with five widely used indices (BOPA, BO2A, BENTIX; AMBI and M-AMBI) in several studies from Southwestern Spain. In addition, we have also established comparisons between these indices and the most commonly used Shannon–Wiener diversity. M-AMBI and BENFES showed the best agreement in ecological status assignation and were the most useful and discriminant between the studied areas. BENTIX was a good discriminant in coastal areas but was severe with the environmental condition from estuaries; BOPA/BO2A did not show clear trends in most of the zones; and AMBI tended to provide overestimations of the ecological status. In conclusion, BENFES shows several advantages such as lower taxonomic resolution, greater reliability and only requiring presence/absence. All this implies a huge possibility to perform a simplified monitoring routine for the control of the ecological quality of water bodies.},

abstract = {In this paper, a marine Biotic Index (BI) for soft-bottom benthos of European estuarine and coastal environments is proposed. This is derived from the proportions of individual abundance in five ecological groups, which are related to the degree of sensitivity/tolerance to an environmental stress gradient. The main difference with previously published indices is the use of a simple formula that produces a continuous Biotic Coefficient (BC) - which makes it more suitable for statistical analysis, in opposition with previous discreet biotic indices - not affected by subjectivity. Relationships between this coefficient and a complementary BI with several environmental variables are discussed. Finally, a validation of the proposed index is made with data from systems affected by recent human disturbances, showing that different anthropogenic changes in the environment can be detected through the use of this BI.

abstract = {We have investigated how indices of beach health perform in predicting the abundances of the crustaceans Emerita brasiliensis and Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis from 22 metropolitan beaches in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Niter{\'{o}}i. Urbanization, Recreation and Conservation indices were used to assess sandy beaches health. Grain size and beach slope were used as morphodynamics indicators. Diagram from the principal component analysis clearly separated beaches with different urbanization and conservation levels. Generalized additive models (GAM's) were adjusted for species abundance using the indices and morphodynamic parameters as explanatory variables. Lower abundances were predicted for beaches with high levels of urbanization, whereas predictions of higher abundances occurred on beaches with high conservation levels. Using theoretic inference we showed that the urbanization index was the most important predictor for abundance of A. brasiliensis and the conservation index was the most important predictor for E. brasiliensis, reflecting different responses by upper tidal and intertidal species. A. brasiliensis occupies the intermediate and upper beach zones and E. brasiliensis is a swash zone filter-feeder that is more abundant in pristine beaches. Both species are highly subject to the impact of bathers and coastal modification. Unexpected, the recreation index did not show a negative effect on abundance predictions. Urbanization and conservation indices can be suitable metrics to measure anthropogenic effects on macrobenthic species. Moreover, mole crabs and sandhoppers species can be easily monitored. Coastal urbanization is a global phenomenon and we used the diagram of urbanization and conservation levels to expose possible directions for management strategies of metropolitan sandy beaches. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rapid coastal development in recent decades has resulted in littoral environmental degradation in Morocco. Casablanca, considered as the economic metropolis driver of the country, is highly impacted by the excess of pollution rejected directly on its shores. The present study aimed at assessing, for the first time, the ecological status (ES) of urban sandy beaches using the Multivariate AZTI Marine Biotic Index (M-AMBI). Five sampling urban beaches around Casablanca [Petite Zenata (PZ), Grande Zenata (GZ), Ain Diab (AD), Sidi Abderrahmane (SD) and Sidi Rahal (SR)] were chosen so as to include a variety of stresses. They were monitored from May 2009 to April 2010 for water and sediment physico-chemical characteristics as well as for their benthic macrofauna in the saturation zone. According to water and sediment analyses, the overall pattern of environmental quality status revealed that wastewater and sewage are significant sources of urban sandy beaches pollution around Casablanca. In the first place, the PZ beach, and, secondarily, the GZ beach were evidenced as the most impacted locations. Both beaches presented high organic matter levels and faecal contamination in the water column that exceeded the human health standards. Furthermore, the total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in sediment highlighted an evident organic enrichment, mainly at PZ beach (TOC {\textgreater} 20{\%}). However, metal contamination was more evident in sediment than in the water column and exceeded rarely the Severe Effect Level. The benthic macrofauna was composed of a total of 28 taxa and revealed intra- and inter-beaches variations. Reference Conditions for the M-AMBI were selected according to historical reference condition combined to expert judgment based on historical data. Globally, M-AMBI worked well on assessing the ES under eutrophication stress due to excess nutrients input. The worst ES was recorded at PZ beach with most of time in bad ES. However, the spatio-temporal changes in the ES were not usually related to the various stressors despite the significant correlations observed between the M-AMBI and some physicochemical features of water and sediment. Sandy beaches are regarded as naturally stressed environments. The wide variations in their environmental conditions make it difficult to discern natural from human-induced changes. Therefore, the "Sandy Beach Quality Paradox" concept is proposed and will certainly be evolved concurrently with the assessment of the ES of sandy beaches. This first attempt on assessing the status of urban sandy beaches of Northeastern Atlantic (Morocco) should be considered as a first step towards more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the impact of human pressures on sandy beaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The influence of static (depth and distance to inland outflows), dynamic (sediment and water column features) environmental variables on density, biomass and mean size was also investigated. The global estimations of kriged density mean was 8.30 ind m−2, biomass mean was 23.78 g m−2, and mean size was 18.71 mm, with the species heterogeneously distributed along the whole sandy subtidal strip of the coast of Huelva. The resulting kriged map shows the location and extension of the patches (5 NM range) in the study area; where the highest density and biomass hot-spots were observed near the river mouths, except for the Guadiana River. This species was present from 3 to 16 m, but preferred the depth window between 6-8 m, having a density and biomass peak at approximately 7 m depth. A negative and significant correlation was found between density/biomass and the coefficient of variation of mean size suggesting a density-dependent process. The most influential factors on density and biomass were depth, sediment characteristics (grain size and percentage of organic content), distance from river mouths and waste water treatment plants, and sea bottom temperature. This study, in addition to reporting on the current status of these natural beds and the influence of dynamic and static environmental variables on their distribution, proposes an additional approach to estimating several biological parameters in C. gallina that could be valuable for the spatial management of this commercial resource and highlight the role of marine protected areas.},

abstract = {Vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) are particularly susceptible to bottom-fishing activity as they are easily disturbed and slow to recover. A data-driven approach was developed to provide management options for the protection of VMEs under the European Union "deep-sea access regulations."A total of two options within two scenarios were developed. The first scenario defined VME closure areas without consideration of fishing activity. Option 1 proposed closures for the protection of VME habitats and likely habitat, while Option 2 also included areas where four types of VME geophysical elements were present. The second scenario additionally considered fishing. This scenario used VME biomass - fishing intensity relationships to identify a threshold where effort of mobile bottom-contact gears was low and unlikely to have caused significant adverse impacts. Achieving a high level of VME protection requires the creation of many closures ({\textgreater} 100), made up of many small (∼50 km2) and fewer larger closures ({\textgreater} 1000 km2). The greatest protection of VMEs will affect approximately 9{\%} of the mobile fleet fishing effort, while closure scenarios that avoid highly fished areas reduce this to around 4-6{\%}. The framework allows managers to choose the level of risk-aversion they wish to apply in protecting VMEs by comparing alternative strategies.},

To date, assessment is carried out on an indicator by indicator basis. Integration of indicators is required to undertake a more holistic assessment of the state of the marine environment. Here, an integrated approach to assess benthic habitats is proposed. Within this conceptual method, four OSPAR benthic habitat indicators relating to biodiversity (D1) and sea-floor integrity (D6) descriptors are linked together. For the integration, benthos, environmental and anthropogenic pressure data are required. State indicators are assessed along a gradient of pressure to facilitate threshold values to be quantified and provide advice on management measures. The method also includes a feedback system whereby best available evidence on benthos, its sensitivity and disturbance assessments can be replaced with ground-truthed data. The proposed method can be expanded to include other related indicators under the different descriptors (e.g. commercial fish and shellfish (D3), food webs (D4) and eutrophication (D5)) where relevant. The concept is a first step towards integration of benthic indicators and could be applied to monitoring requirements under other Directives such as the Habitat or Water Framework Directive.},

abstract = {Applying an ecosystem approach requires a deep and holistic understanding of interactions between human activities and ecosystems. Bottom trawling is the most widespread physical human disturbance in the seabed and produces a wide range of direct and indirect impacts on benthic ecosystems. In this work, we develop a new index, the BEnthos Sensitivity Index to Trawling Operations (BESITO), using biological traits to classify species according to their sensitivity to bottom trawling. Seventy-nine different benthic taxa were classified according to their BESITO scores in three groups. The effect of trawling on the relative abundance of each group (measured as biomass proportion) was analysed using General Additive Models (GAMs) in a distribution model framework. The distribution of the relative biomass of each group was mapped and the impact of trawling was computed. Species with the lowest BESITO score (group I) showed a positive response to trawling disturbance (opportunistic response) whereas species with values higher than 2 (group III) showed a negative response (sensitive response). Species with a BESITO score of 2 did not show a significant response to the pressure (tolerant response). Trawling disturbance reduced relative biomass of sensitive species by 31{\%} across the study area. This value increased to 46{\%} when shelf-break was considered in isolation and reached values of 59.6{\%} in the most impacted habitat (deep-sea muddy sands). The new index classified successfully the analysed species according to their sensitivity to trawling allowing modeling the impact of trawling disturbance on sensitive species, without the masking effect of opposed responses.},

abstract = {The concept of Ecological Integrity (EI) refers to the capacity of a place to sustain and maintain the biota in such conditions that allows it to function as a balanced, integrated and adaptive system, and can be derived by comparing present vs. past or spatial reference baseline conditions. Here we assess the EI of Playa El Rivero (34°2'29.35”S, 53∘32'21.14”W) in Punta Del Diablo resort, Uruguay. This 600 m-length, previously unstudied sandy beach is one of the main attractions of the resort, receiving thousands of tourists during summer. Accordingly, conspicuous human impacts are concentrated in the more dissipative end of the beach. In order to derive EI values, a large number of indicators (n=20), including population and community level univariate descriptors for benthic macrofauna, as well as direct indicators of EI (AMBI, M-AMBI and Buckland indices) were assessed and integrated. The distribution of population and community level variables were compared across the along-shore axis with the expected distribution under the Swash Exclusion Hypothesis (SHE) and the Habitat Harshness Hypothesis (HHH), which predict a decrease in richness, biomass and abundance from reflective to dissipative conditions. To derive a global value, an EI value was calculated for population and community levels as well as according to direct impact indicators. EI thus ranged from 1 (no measurable or significant impacts) to 0 (completely dysfunctional system). Integrating all types of indicators, a value of 0.76 was obtained for the beach under study. This value integrates both chronic and putative “press” disturbance occurring during the high tourist season in the period under study and suggests a sub-optimal state (ca. 20{\%} reduction) of the health of the system studied, probably related to the sum of chronic anthropogenic impacts that the beach arc presents. This value is considered as an objective (but probably conservative) reference point in order to evaluate the effectiveness of future management measures.},

A total of 48 different species were identified, of which fish and crustaceans were the most abundant groups. General patterns indicated that warm periods showed higher levels of abundance and species richness than colder periods, and the community's biomass increased at sunset as opposed to sunrise, however, this was not the case for species richness or abundance. The type of beach, on the other hand, had no significant effects. The analysis of abundance by taxa indicated that the most significant responses to the beach, season, time of day, and moon-phase predictors were by the species Trachinotus ovatus, Haplostylus normani, and Crangon crangon. In addition, water temperature together with wave height were the most determining factors affecting the abundance of the most dominant species in the community. Furthermore, our research suggests that sandy beach surf zones are used as a nursery by fish species and that these environments are where short and mid-term spatial-temporal variations of the community's structure occur.},

abstract = {In international fisheries management, scientific advice on the presence of "vulnerable marine ecosystems" (VMEs) per United Nations resolutions, has generally used qualitative assessments based on expert judgment of the occurrence of indicator taxa such as cold-water corals and sponges. Use of expert judgment alone can be criticized for inconsistency and sometimes a lack of transparency; therefore, development of robust and repeatable numeric methods to detect the presence of VMEs would be advantageous. Here, we present a multi-criteria assessment (MCA) method to evaluate how likely a given area of seafloor represents a VME. The MCA is a taxa-dependent spatial method that accounts for both the quantity and data quality available. This was applied to a database of records of VMEs built, held and compiled by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). A VME index was generated which ranged from 1.51 to 4.52, with 5.0 being reserved for confirmed VME habitats. An index of confidence was also computed that ranged from 0.0 to 0.75, with 1 being reserved for those confirmed VME habitats. Overall the MCA captured the important elements of the ICES VME database and provided a simplified, spatially aggregated, and weighted estimate of how likely a given area is to contain VMEs. The associated estimate of confidence gave an indication of how uncertain that assessment was for the same given area. This methodology provides a more systematic and standardized approach for assessing the likelihood of presence of VMEs in the North-East Atlantic.},

A total of 27 species were found, of which Donax trunculus, Diogenes pugilator, and Tritia grana were the most abundant. Anthropogenic effects are appreciable in the infralittoral-sublittoral although they are areas that are permanently submerged and less exposed than the intertidal. Beach nourishments carried out with large volumes of sand can alter the grain size, the most influential parameter on the distribution of the species, and consequently, affect the macrofauna community that inhabits these beaches.},

@article{Schlacher2014,
abstract = {Complexity is increasingly the hallmark in environmental management practices of sandy shorelines. This arises primarily from meeting growing public demands (e.g., real estate, recreation) whilst reconciling economic demands with expectations of coastal users who have modern conservation ethics. Ideally, shoreline management is underpinned by empirical data, but selecting ecologically-meaningful metrics to accurately measure the condition of systems, and the ecological effects of human activities, is a complex task. Here we construct a framework for metric selection, considering six categories of issues that authorities commonly address: erosion; habitat loss; recreation; fishing; pollution (litter and chemical contaminants); and wildlife conservation. Possible metrics were scored in terms of their ability to reflect environmental change, and against criteria that are widely used for judging the performance of ecological indicators (i.e., sensitivity, practicability, costs, and public appeal). From this analysis, four types of broadly applicable metrics that also performed very well against the indicator criteria emerged: 1.) traits of bird populations and assemblages (e.g., abundance, diversity, distributions, habitat use); 2.) breeding/reproductive performance sensu lato (especially relevant for birds and turtles nesting on beaches and in dunes, but equally applicable to invertebrates and plants); 3.) population parameters and distributions of vertebrates associated primarily with dunes and the supralittoral beach zone (traditionally focused on birds and turtles, but expandable to mammals); 4.) compound measurements of the abundance/cover/biomass of biota (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) at both the population and assemblage level. Local constraints (i.e., the absence of birds in highly degraded urban settings or lack of dunes on bluff-backed beaches) and particular issues may require alternatives. Metrics - if selected and applied correctly - provide empirical evidence of environmental condition and change, but often do not reflect deeper environmental values per se. Yet, values remain poorly articulated for many beach systems; this calls for a comprehensive identification of environmental values and the development of targeted programs to conserve these values on sandy shorelines globally. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Serrano2022,
abstract = {Indicators are key tools used to assess the ecological status of the environment for ecosystem based management. Anthropogenic disturbances produce changes to habitat condition, which include modifications in species composition and their functions. Monitoring a group of sentinel species (from a taxonomic and functional point of view) provides useful insights into benthic habitat condition. Here, a new indicator, Sentinels of the Seabed (SoS) is proposed to assess state of benthic habitats using “sentinel” species (species which are characteristic of a habitat and sensitive to a given pressure). The selection of these sentinel species has two stages. First, a ‘typical species set' is computed using intra-habitat similarity and frequency under reference conditions. Second, the ‘sentinel species set' is generated by selecting the most sensitive species from the typical species set. This selection is made using specific indexes able to assess species sensitivity to a particular pressure. The SoS indicator method was tested on six case studies and two different pressure types (trawling disturbance and pollution), using data from otter trawl, box-corer and Remote Operate Vehicle images. In each scenario, the SoS indicator was compared to the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef index and total biomass, being the only metric, which showed the expected significant negative response to pressure in all cases. Our results shows that SoS was highly effective in assessing benthic habitats status under both physical and chemical pressures, regardless of the sampling gear, the habitat, or the case study, showing a great potential to be a useful tool in the management of marine ecosystems.},
